	scave: IDList: implemented equals(), bulkAdd() etc.

	ide/scave: Data Export dialog title and description tweak

	it, which was a performance disaster if IDList contains many thousands of
	IDs.

	ide/scave: IDListSelection performance improvement

	"Select all" in the Browse Data page could take forever, due to internal
	IDList <--> Long[] conversions. Now that IDListSelection stores an IDList

	DeadlockException on startup, and is no longer relevant.

2019-05-08  Attila Torok

	* Remove dependency on the now defunct AERI (error reporting service).

2019-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	ide: fixed bug report and model descriptor download URLs

2019-12-19  Rudolf Hornig

	* Update to Eclipse 4.14 and CDT 9.10

2019-11-08  Andras Varga

	* Rudimentary IDE support for new parameter type "object" (syntax highlight).

2019-10-28  Attila Torok

	* Sequence Chart: Add a (potential) axis for any module with a custom
	@class, instead of only those that do not have any submodules. These used to
	be the same, but not anymore in INET, with the new "tricky" compound modules
	that handle some messages themselves. This works around issues #759 and
	#778.

2019-11-14  Attila Torok

	* Install INET 4 (the inet4 project) from FirstStepsDialog.

2019-11-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* Model catalog URL updated

2019-08-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix incorrect product ID.

2019-07-31  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: Implementors table to include indirect implementors as well.

2019-07-31  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: Generate "Implementors" table for interfaces.

2019-07-31  Andras Varga

	* NEDDoc: fix: Inheritance diagrams were missing in module interface pages,
	even if they had implementors. This bug made INET documentation much less
	useful.

	Cause: hasBaseType was too restrictive, and its value didn't align with
	what generateInheritanceDiagram() was doing.

	Solution: always generate the dot graph, and check afterwards if it has
	content.

2019-07-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use bundled private JRE on all platforms.

2019-07-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Debug launch config to use lldbmi2 by default on macOS.

	* Eclipse 4.11 update, Tycho 1.3.0 update for building

2019-03-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Renamed the launcher executable to opp_ide. The same launcher name will be

2019-02-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to Eclipse 4.11, tycho 1.3.

2019-02-11  Andras Varga

	* Sequence Chart: follow rename of ModuleMethodBegin/End to ComponentMethodBegin/End.

	Note: the Sequence Chart tool cannot visualize methods calls from/to
	channel objects, as they have no axes in the chart.

2019-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added a bookmark file specifying all used update sites.

	The site bookmark file can be imported in the Eclipse / Preferences /
	Install/Update / Available Software Sites dialog. It contains update
	sites for Eclipse Platform, CDT, GEF, PyDev, Linux Tools.

2019-01-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed dependency file generation

	The dependency file generated by a .msg and the related object file's
	dependency file were overwriting each other.

2019-01-18  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build process refactoring

2018-12-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Releng: moved to the root directory

2018-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	* NED documentation generator updated. [This is a summary of several commits.]

	  - Generate material design inspired output.

	  - Navigation tree revised.

	  - It is now possible to specify excluded directories during documentation
	    generation, in order to be able to exclude samples, showcases etc. that
	    are not integral part of the documentation.

	  - Now generates nedtags.xml/msgtags.xml file which is compatible with
	    the doxytags.xml file generated by doxygen. This allows crosslinking to
	    the ned documentation from a sphinx based documentation (using the
	    doxy-link plugin)

	  - Generate usage and inheritance diagrams ONLY if they are meaningful.

	  - Use SVG files as the usage/inheritance diagram image. Removed map
	    files as SVG already contains proper links.

2018-11-26  Andras Varga

	* NED Editor, Sequence Chart: allow SVG export.

	* Makemake dialog: allow setting DLL export symbol from OMNeT++.

2018-08-01  Attila Torok

	* CachingCanvas: Remove a workaround for Eclipse bug #245523 (fixed).
	Affects both the Analysis Tool and Sequence Chart Tool.

2017-06-07  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool redesign, 1st phase. This is a summary of several commits by Andras
	Varga, 	over the period of 2017-04-07 through 2017-06-07.

	A partial list of changes:

	- Data model change: added Dataset, Chartsheet and Folder

	- Datasets page replaced by an IconGridViewer that displays chart icons.
	  Charts will be created from scripts instead of tree-edited steps like
	  "add", "apply" and "chart".

	- Remove dependency on Eclipse EMF -- ecore data model was replaced by
	  hand-coded classed, to reduce bloat and for greater control.

	- Editor pages: added a toolbar to the top-right inner corner, use that
	  instead of the main Eclipse toolbar.

	- Inputs page redesigned and rewritten (basically from scratch)

	- Browse Data page: filter strip: remove "Apply" button; "Swap" button moved
	  to left

	- Browse Data page: Tree Levels and Choose Table Columns actions added to
	  toolbar

	- Browse Data page: right-align numeric colums

	- Browse Data page: copy to clipboard action: added icon

	- Browse Data page: added Increase/Decrease Precision actions

	- Browse Data page: data tree was missing icons (used a folder icon)
	  for some item types

	- Browse Data page: adjust preset tree levels: "File" -> "File / Run"

	- Browse Data page: table filter: replace RunId filter with
	  Experiment/Measurement/Replication

	- Exporter improvements: validate dialog on start; enable/disable Export
	  action based on the contents of the selection

	- Charts: default legend positioning changed from "off" to "inside,
	  anchor north"

	- During development, existing Analysis Tool code was preserved for reference,
	  as plugins org.omnetpp.scave_orig and org.omnetpp.scave.model_orig, and
	  later removed.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed unused IDE build scripts. Replaced by releng.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove abandoned Standalone Sequence Chart, due to lack of interest.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove abandoned IDE-based animation plugins.

	This was offline animation, i.e. play-back from the eventlog file
	recorded from the simulation.

	This effort pre-dated the Canvas API, OSG/osgEarth support, smooth
	animation using refreshDisplay(), and Qtenv.

	Originally abandoned due to scalability concerns (eventlog file can be
	huge), but now a huge drawback would be lack of support for recent
	animation APIs used with Qtenv (Canvas, OSG/osgEarth, refreshDisplay()).

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Remove the IDE-based simulation front-end plugin, a shelved project.

	This plugin requires a custom Cmdenv, as it communicates with the
	simulation process that runs in the background via HTTP JSON requests.

	This attempt has pre-dated the Canvas API, OSG/osgEarth and Qtenv.
	Abandoned mainly due to scalability concerns (too much socket
	communication between simulation process and GUI front-end), and more
	recently, due to OSG which would be difficult to integrate into Eclipse.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed the abandoned Standalone Analysis Tool, due to lack of interest.

2018-11-22  Andras Varga

	* Removed abandoned GUI tester and usage tracker plugins, unused for ~10
	years.

2018-07-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to Eclipse 4.8

2018-06-26  Andras Varga

	* Follow change: Remove references to Tkenv.

2020-01-06  ------ omnetpp-5.6 released ------

2020-01-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use Eclipse 4.14 and CDT 9.10.

2019-12-13  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Made the "Project Features" menu item more creative in finding
	the project. (It said "Select a project first" much too often.)

2019-10-07  Attila Torok

	* Analysis Tool: Fix weighted histogram PDF/CDF computation (use sum of
	weights instead of observation count).

2019-10-25  Attila Torok

	* NED editor: added manual connection routing using the "m" tag.

2019-10-30  Attila Torok

	* SequenceChart: Avoid out of bounds error when selecting manual axis
	ordering, or switching between "Manual" and "Minimize crossings" modes.

2019-10-28  Attila Torok

	* EventlogTable, SequenceChart: Strip ANSI escape sequences from log
	message lines.

2019-08-24  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: Fix "Failed to create the part's controls" error due to
	"assertion failed: file is not a NED file, or not parsed yet".

2019-08-06  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Let the user permanently turn off the "OMNeT++ libraries not yet
	compiled" dialog.

2019-05-14  Attila Torok

	* IDE: Remove AERI (now defunct logging service) reference.

2018-11-20  Attila Torok

	* IDE: Avoid NPE when web browser could not be created.

2019-02-11  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: fix recently introduced runtime error during connecting
	nodes.

2018-07-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Fix: NedType and Msgtape tags had different value in C++ and Java.

2019-12-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated to use Eclipse 4.13, CDT 9.9.

2019-05-15  ------ omnetpp-5.5 released ------

2019-04-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* fix NPE in workspace import when the initial welcome screen closed
	on the latest eclipse

2019-03-25  Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated tycho/antrunner/pomless plugin versions + fixed version
	number replacements

2019-03-21  Rudolf Hornig

	* Use Eclipse 4.11, CDT 9.7

2019-02-09  Andras Varga

	* ide: removing "bgl" display string tag

	Store seed in the figure instead of the display string tag. Change
	Relayout action accordingly.

	The "bgl" could be used to specify the layout seed for the compound
	module. It has not been supported by Qtenv, as it was unclear how it was
	supposed to coexist with Qtenv's "Relayout" button. We are now removing
	it altogether.

2018-07-06  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed the trashy cursors during connection drag and new module
	creation with GTK3. The IDE now runs with GTK3. Both the cursor issue
	and the missing 3-state checkbox issue in the launcher dialog has been fixed.

2018-06-25  ------ omnetpp-5.4.1 released ------

2018-06-13  Andras Varga

	* NED: fix: in a "compound-extends-simple" situation, base was not
	added to the inheritance chain

	simple A {
	   gates:
	       inout g;
	}

	module B extends A {  // <---- despite this, internally B did NOT extend
	A
	}

	module C {
	   submodules:
	       b1: B;
	       b2: B;
	   connections:
	       b1.g <--> b2.g; // ERROR (bogus): gate 'g' not found in 'B'
	}

2018-06-13  Levente Mészáros

	* NED editor: Solved unused deep parameter assignment in NED file
	analysis.

	moduleinterface IMac
	{
	}

	module Mac like IMac
	{
	   parameters:
	       int x;
	}

	module Test
	{
	   parameters: WARN-->     mac.x = 2;
	   submodules:
	       mac: <default("Mac")> like IMac;
	}

2018-06-13  Andras Varga

	* NED: fix: when a compound module extends a simple module, references to
	the base module's gates and parameters were reported as errors ("unknown
	gate", etc.)

2018-06-13  Levente Mészáros

	* NED editor: Solved unused deep parameter assignment in NED file analysis

2018-06-11  ------ omnetpp-5.4 released ------

2018-06-05  Attila Torok

	* Launcher: fix: The IDE sometimes started build in the UI thread,
	locking up the UI for the time of the build, potentially for several
	minutes.

2018-06-05  Attila Torok

	* Fix "unknown" image as module background in the graphical NED	editor.

2018-06-04  Andras Varga

	* Fix: do not report "undefined parameter" for typename assignments in NED

2018-06-01  Andras Varga

	* Fix: inifile analysis: typename deep assignments in NED were ignored

2018-04-11  ------ omnetpp-5.3 released ------

2018-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Fix: added --add-modules vm argument to eclipse.ini to be compatible
	with JDK 9

2017-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generator: follow opp_makemake change: generate dependency
	files for .msg files too (if they use imports)

2017-11-30  Andras Varga

	* Updated for nedxml library changes

2017-12-08  ------ omnetpp-5.2.1 released ------

2017-12-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Launcher: fix for program name validation.

2017-09-18  ------ omnetpp-5.2 released ------

2017-09-18  Andras Varga

	* Removed "Add OMNeT++ Support" from the "File" menu

	Reason: it did not add C++ support.

	Replacement: delete the project from the workspace (but leave its
	files!), and create a project over it using the "New OMNeT++ Project"
	wizard. You existing files will appear under the new project.

2017-09-18  Andras Varga

	* Makemake Options dialog: layout fixes

2017-08-25  Andras Varga

	* Launching: no not offer ".qtenv.ini" when creating launch
	configuration

2017-07-16  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Updated for 'statistic' items and for weighted statistics.

	Background: Specifying "record=stats" in a @statistic NED property, or
	or calling the record() method on a cStddDev object saves a "statistic"
	object in the output scalar file (.sca). A "statistic" object includes
	fields like the count of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum
	and maximum value. "statistic" objects so far have been blown up to
	several unrelated scalars upon loading into the Analysis Tool, and were
	not available as objects. Now they are loaded as objects, and appear in
	the Histograms and All tabs of the Browse Data page. Statistics fields
	continue to be available as scalars as well, so they can be used as
	chart input.

	Also, weighted statistics (like those saved from cWeightedStddev) were
	not properly displayed in the Analysis Tool. This has been rectified
	as well.

	Details:
	- The Histograms tab on the Browse Data page now includes "statistics"-
	  type results as well.

	- The Histograms tab now has new table columns: "Kind", "SumWeights",
	  "#Bins", "Hist.Range", all displayed by default. "Kind" indicates
	  whether a result item is a "statistic" or a "histogram", and whether
	  it is weighted or unweighted.

	- Individual fields of "statistic" and "histogram" result items are
	  no longer displayed on the Scalars page.

	- Properties for "statistic" and "histogram" result items now includes
	  "Kind" ("weighted"/"unweighted") and "Sum of weights".

	- The "Variance" line has been removed from Properties view because
	  it's not too useful and can be easily computed as the square of the
	  standard deviation.

	- Missing or unavailable data in table cells is now displayed with a
	  hyphen instead of "n.a."

	- On the All tab of Browse Data page, result item fields are now in
	  natural order (i.e. no longer in alphabetically sorted).

	- New icon for scalar items on the All tab of Browse Data page

2017-06-27  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: better display of histogram bins in the Properties view.
	The display format of bins was changed from "a..b" to "[a,b)", in order
	to clearly indicate that "a" is	inclusive and "b" is exclusive.

2017-06-21  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Export dialog refined

	- Dialog now comes up with correct size (XSWT form fully visible)
	- Better filename generation/validation
	- Disable Finish button when filename field is empty
	- Added 'Open exported file afterwards' checkbox
	- Other refinements

2017-04-06  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: final removal of export code (it was no longer
	accessible from	the GUI since version 5.1.)

2017-04-04  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tools: changed the syntax for accessing iteration variables
	in filter expressions. Before, they could be accessed like run attributes,
	with the "attr:" prefix. Now, one needs to use the "itervar:" prefix,
	which is more explicit.

2017-03-31  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Properties view: properly display attributes, iteration
	variables and parameter assignments for runs

2017-03-20  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Properties view: removed "Number of lines" and
	"Unrecognized lines" entries from the properties of result files

2017-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: updated Eclipse for the final Oxygen release

2017-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	* Run/Debug Launchers: changes related to "build before launch" and
	recent changes in debug/release builds.

	- The Run, Profile and Debug launch types now automatically trigger build.

	- The launcher now switches the project (and optionally all projects it
	  depends on) to the appropriate build configuration if necessary: Run
	  and Profile will perform RELEASE build, Debug will perform DEBUG build.

	- For Debug launch, the "_dbg" suffix is added implicitly to the target
	  name (both exe and shared lib), and it is expected that the simulation
	  will also load the "_dbg" versions of libraries.

	- A new "Build before launch" section was added to the Launch config
	  dialog, which allows you to control whether to switch build configuration
	  automatically, or ask before the build. The scope of build can also
	  configured; options are: "None", "This project", or "Project + dependencies".

	- If the launch is configured as "Ask before build" (default), a
	  confirmation dialog is shown on launch (and before the build), asking
	  whether to switch the active build configuration to appropriate one.
	  The dialog allows you to set the decision as permanent and reconfigures
	  the launch config accordingly.

2017-05-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generator: follow changes in the command-line opp_makemake tool

	- Models are built in RELEASE mode by default. Until now, DEBUG was the
	  default, which resulted in casual users always running their simulations
	  in DEBUG mode, i.e. much slower than possible.

	- RELEASE and DEBUG mode binaries can now co-exist, so users do not have
	  to recompile when they switch modes (e.g. when they want to debug a
	  simulation -- remember, they are built in RELEASE mode by default.)
	  This is a significant gain especially for large models like INET.
	  The goal was achieved by adding the "_dbg" suffix to the names of
	  DEBUG-mode binaries.

	- Binaries are now hard-linked from the build directory (out/) to the
	  target directory instead of being soft-linked. This leaves the copy
	  in the build directory intact when the one in the target directory
	  is deleted.

2017-05-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Use statically linked stdc++ library for the IDE native lib for
	better compatibility.

2017-05-12  Rudolf Hornig

	* Simulation Launcher: better progress reporting and cancellation
	for batch runs. Internally, this is the result of switching to the
	new JobGroups API of Eclipse.

2017-05-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: use Eclipse Oxygen milestone builds (platform version 4.6.2)

2017-05-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE's native library is now using statically linked c++ standard
	library to avoid binary dependency on libstdc++. This reduces the possibility
	of compatibility issues on older systems.

2017-05-08  ------ omnetpp-5.1.1 released ------

2017-04-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Fixed a problem where the IDE was not able to load its native
	library	if it was not started from the MinGW shell.

	* The IDE now properly detects whether it is using MinGW or Clang/C2.

2017-03-31  ------ omnetpp-5.1 released ------

2017-03-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: switch to using the new exporters in the scave library
	and new Export dialog.

2017-02-21  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: Old export wizard renamed

2017-03-04  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: tweak SWIG wrapping to accommodate changes in the scave library

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: tweak SWIG wrapping to accommodate changes in the scave library

2017-02-17  Andras Varga

	* Analysis Tool: remove octave and matlab export from the IDE

	Reasons:

	1. poor data representation chosen in the output file, esp. for vector
	   (one time vector, and one value vector per OMNeT++ output vector,
	   where most values were NaN due to the common T vector!
	   2-column matrices for each vector would have been a better choice.)

	2. We don't want to promote Matlab/Octave use for result analysis.
	   Matlab/Octave users should use CSV export.

	Note: octaveexport.cc/h were unused (not in build).

2017-03-10  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: allow C++11 (compiler flag comes from CXXFLAGS)

2017-02-16  Andras Varga

	* nativelibs: added missing %ignore

2017-03-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix NPE when deleting folder in a non-C++ project

2017-03-13  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: use Eclipse 4.6.3 milestone builds

2017-03-17  Rudolf Hornig

	* NPE and logging fixes

2017-03-09  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile generation: follow opp_makemake change: improved the "clean"
	target in the generated makefiles (recursive wildcard; delete only the
	actual target)

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Eventlog view: selection handling fixes
	   - Temporarily disabled reusing selection (due to NPE) after filtering
	     the eventlog
	   - Fixed dangling focusElement on input change.
	   - Changed selection marks to be more apparent.
	   - Fixed revealing selected element in VirtualTable.

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Eventlog view: Fixed foreground color when the table
	widget is not focused.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix #941: Recursively including ini file makes
	OMNeT++ workspace unusable

2017-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: parser: ParseException is never used, eliminated.
	Also: wrap IOException into CoreException

2017-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Launch dialog fix: debug-on-errors did not take effect for DEBUG
	launch on a fresh launch config. Just opening and closing the Debug
	dialog fixed it (it wrote the setting into the launch config).

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Launch dialog page: fix: config name "Gen" could not be restored.

	"General" was chosen instead, because code used simple startsWith() call
	to test, and "General" came before "Gen" in the list (??).

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: fix: form edits were lost when typing too quickly
	after hitting Enter. Cause: reread() overwrote user's edits.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Inifile Editor: Fix #1001: form editor: "Reset to default" button
	pops up "No such entry" error dialog

2017-03-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added default Eclipse repositories as update sites

2017-03-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added automatic Eclipse reporting support to OMNeT++ (not to OMNEST)

2017-03-02  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed dummy MSVC toolchain definition

2017-03-03  Levente Meszaros

	* SequenceChart: Changed selection marks to be more apparent.

	* SequenceChart: Fixed revealing selected element in VirtualTable.

	* SequenceChart: Fixed foreground color for EventLogTable when the widget is not
	focused.

2017-03-02  Andras Varga

	* Fix #941: Recursively including ini file makes OMNeT workspace
	unusable

	* Launcher fix: debug-on-errors did not take effect on a fresh launch
	config

	* Launch dialog page: fix: config name "Gen" could not be restored.
	"General" was chosen instead, because code used simple startsWith() call
	to test, and "General" came before "Gen" in the list...

	* Ini editor fix: edits lost when typing too quickly after hitting
	Enter

	* Fix #1001: Ini form editor: "Reset to default" button pops up "No
	such entry" error dialog

2017-03-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added default eclipse repositories as update sites

	* Added automatic Eclipse reporting support to OMNeT++ (not to OMNEST)

	* Removed dummy MSVC toolchain definition

2017-02-06  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre3 released ------

2017-02-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added CDT repo so plugins can be installed from there directly (It
	was required to add LLDB debugger support as it is not part of the main
	repo.

2017-01-27  Andras Varga

	* "New empty project" wizard: do NOT generate package.ned. Change fixes
	the TicToc tutorial.

2017-01-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Added lldb support plugins

2017-01-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Upgraded to Eclipse 4.6.2

2017-01-26  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE now generates exactly the same makefile as the opp_makemake
	tool. This allows easier switching between IDE and command line without
	rebuilding the model.

2017-01-16  Andras Varga

	* Fix tri-state checkboxes. Affects launch dialog and Analysis tool chart
	properties dialog.

2017-01-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* neddoc: made the doxy file path relative to the project. This fixes the
	issue in windows.

2016-11-21  Levente Meszaros

	* Debug launch: GDB init file changed from python2 to python3 syntax

2016-12-23  ------ omnetpp-5.1pre2 released ------

2016-12-19  Andras Varga

	* IDE: Inifile editor updated with new/changed options

2016-12-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: updated logo images

2016-11-25  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: initial support for SQLite-based result files [Zoltan
	Bojthe, Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga]

2016-12-05  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: renamed default config names from gcc-debug -> debug.

2016-12-01  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: removed Visual C++ specific code, as now we support the
	Visual C++ compiler with the normal makefiles and build mechanism.

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Inifile editor, Launcher: support for cmdenv-stop-batch-on-error

2016-11-11  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: "Silent" checkbox replaced by "Verbose"

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: more/better tooltips

2016-11-18  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: don't force --debug-on-errors=false in RUN mode. Reason:
	user may want to launch simulation using RUN, and use an external
	debugger to debug it.

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: "Debug on errors" made tri-state checkbox

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: added hint for the run filter

2016-11-14  Andras Varga

	* IDE: omnetpp-ide.launch updated

2016-11-16  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: detecting external changes in the generated header file
	made more robust: made comparison insensitive to comment, whitespace and
	order differences.

2016-11-16  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: fix: could not properly fix NED
	exclusions list

	The old NED exclusions list always came back after "fixing" the project
	configuration from the Project Features property page. (.nedexclusions
	with updated content was saved to disk, then on "Apply" it was
	overwritten with old content.)

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Launcher improvements

	- tolerate lack of console (no NPE in stream monitor)
	- on simulation error, display concrete message in the error dialog,
	  not just "Finished with error"
	- code structuring for readability

2016-10-27  Andras Varga

	* Launch page: UI revamp

	- use tristate checkboxes instead of Yes/No/Default radio buttons or combos
	- UI: use editable combo instead
	- working dir merged into Simulation group
	- Qtenv to precede Tkenv
	- Batch settings into separate group
	- introduced explicit "useBatching" checkbox
	- debug-on-errors: replace combo with checkbox that appears only in DEBUG
	  mode (and fixed "false" in RUN mode)
	- use our own SWTFactory
	- added simulation time limit / CPU time limit
	- added content assist for Additional Arguments
	- hook modificatoin listeners automatically
	- etc.

2016-10-07  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: allow simulations execute in batches

	OmnetppMainTab: added "Batch size" spinner, etc.

	Added JobGroup-based alternative implementation code as comment (it
	currently does not work, because progress reporting from job groups is
	broken, see Eclipse bugtracker)

2016-10-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: set all plugin's minimum runtime requirement to JRE 1.8

2016-10-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Updated to eclipse 4.6.1

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Fix NPE on startup when open ANF file was deleted since last session

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: display Experiment/Measurement/Replication columns in
	Browse Data tables instead of Folder/Filename/RunId/Config/RunNumber.

	Note that this is only the default values for a preference, so change
	will only take effect in new installations (or delete delete scave
	preferences from .metadata/org.eclipse.core.runtime/...)

	Also: increase default columns widths

2016-10-19  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: updated generation of default anf file names from
	vec/sca file names

2016-10-12  Andras Varga

	* Launcher: make simulation batch cancellable; getting run list was
	broken by a recent commit

2016-10-12  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed incorrect tooltip background/foreground colors.

	Added colorLock flag to prevent the eclipse styling mechanism from
	overriding colors already set on the widget. Added kludge to workaround
	the fact that the HTML parser returns black colors for
	foreground/background even when they were not specified. Removed colors
	from HTML prolog to fallback to system defaults.

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Analysis tool: dark scheme fix

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* NED editor: improvement for dark color schemes (removed grey strip
	from "package" heading)

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile edtor: icons: better transparency (for dark color schemes)

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile form editor: improvements for the dark color scheme

2016-10-10  Andras Varga

	* Inifile editor: fix "widget already disposed" error

2016-10-05  Levente Meszaros

	* Fixed incorrect swig mapping for ptr_t/uintptr_t.

2016-11-30  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed 'nmake' support from the IDE. The Microsoft Clang/C2 compiler
	now works with the same configuration as the MinGW compiler.

	* Added support for 64-bit builds with both the MinGW-W64 and the Clang/C2
	compilers.

2016-08-04  Rudolf Hornig

	* While detecting the omnetpp_root directory, check all parent
	directories for Makefile.inc

2016-08-03  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: removed 32-bit linux support for the IDE

2016-07-20  Rudolf Hornig

	* build: The native IDE build script now creates Windows 64, Linux 64 and
	macOS shared libraries.

2016-05-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* The IDE build system is now using Eclipse 4.6 and Maven/Tycho

2016-05-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* Removed deprecated construct + handled IllegalArgumentException when
	invalid path is entered in the IMAGE_PATH

2016-07-08  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: features.h banner change, and more fixes

	- fix NPE when opening Project Features dialog for a project with no
	  features defined
	- String getDefinesFileName() -> IFile getDefinesFile()

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* test/* added IDE test projects for testing the linker/compiler
	options, include path etc. [Rudi]

	Exercises the following IDE build features:
	- multiple projects
	- multiple makemake folders per project
	- target types: static lib, shared lib, executable
	- linked project (i.e. not directly under the workspace dir)
	- project references, >2 deep
	- project features (.oppfeatures)
	- include folders: defined in CDT (Paths&Symbols page), by project
	  features, and in makemake -I options
	- defines: defined ibn CDT (Paths&Symbols page), by project features, and
	  in makemame -D options
	- message files, used in referenced projects

	Pass criteria:
	- project must compile, resulting executable must start
	- content of generated makefiles is checked against a saved copy

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* ProjectFeaturesManager: warn for missing definesFile attribute

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* ProjectFeaturesManager: offer removing "WITH_TCP" etc macros from
	CDT configuration. Now they come from header file, and only cause
	confusion.

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* Added BuildSpecFolderRenameDetector, MsgFileRemoveDetector

	They:
	- remove _m.cc/h files when their msg is deleted
	- make .oppbuildspec files follow folder renames

2016-07-04  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: convert paths to relative for makemake

2016-07-04  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: collect include path recursively; linker settings:
	only use directly referenced projects

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: renames; add -L for referenced projects even if we
	dont automatically link with their libs

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: better values for the FOO_PROJ=... variables

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: fix include path exported from referenced projects

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MetaMakemake: refactor: split up addFeatureCFlagsTo() /
	addFeatureLDFlagsTo()

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: remember manually added -L options

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: Compile tab: put some options under a More>>>
	link

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: disable useFeatureLDFlagsCheckbox if not
	applicable

2016-07-01  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: don't lose manually entered options in the
	Preview pane

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added note, wrap label

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added checkboxes for metaFeatureCFlags and
	metaFeatureLDFlags

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: make MakemakeOptionsDialog resizable

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptionsPanel: added Include directories listbox to the
	Compile page

2016-06-30  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptions: added "." as default include dir

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* MakemakeOptions: change order of generated options

2016-06-29  Rudolf Hornig

	* Build: for gmake builds removed the CONFIGNAME from the invokation
	command line.

	Make will use the automatically detected toolchain name (detected by
	./configure). In practice this means that once a project is built from
	the IDE, issuing a make command from the command line will not rebuild it
	from scratch.

2016-06-29  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: validate the saved project state,
	not the edited one

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* Project Features property page: removed "Export build tester
	makefile" feature. We now have an opp_featuretool-based shell script
	for the same purpose.

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Project Features: handle defines with generated header file instead
	of macros in the CDT project configuration. Needs definesFile="..."
	in the root element of .oppfeatures

	* ProjectFeaturesPropertyPage: display name of generated header file

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Metamakemake: use absolute paths for -L, it will be converted
	to relative inside the Makemake class later (in a better way than
	makeRelativePath() can)

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Added metaExportIncludePath, metaUseExportedIncludePaths

2016-07-05  Andras Varga

	* Removed deep-includes option from the IDE and opp_makemake

	As it turned out, it was not all that useful (too error-prone
	for large projects like INET where it was originally targeted)

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* IncludeFoldersCache: cache deep-include folders ONLY (based on
	makemake options)

	Don't add non-deepinclude makemake folders to the include path -- if
	that's needed, it should be done explicitly in the Paths&Symbols page.

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* Makemake: removed Autoinclude option -- always use include folders
	from the Path&Symbols page

	It was convenient but a messy, for example the -I options in the generate
	Makefiles did not match with the contents of the Paths&Symbols page.

	Better make everything explicit -- and more predictable.

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* IncludeFoldersCache changes:
	1. fix: skip non-omnetpp projects
	2. rewrite to discover and maintain list of include folders, base on makemake options

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Removed dependency cache from the IDE.

	Remaining issue: MetaMakemake used to take automatic include folders from
	DependencyCache, this no longer works

2016-06-24  Andras Varga

	* Fix: don't save makemake options for non-makemake folders

2016-06-28  Andras Varga

	* Fix long-standing MetaMakemake bug

2016-06-23  Rudolf Hornig

	* Makefile now uses compiler-generated dependency files.

2013-10-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed the launcher not to throw error if the toolchain is clang.

2013-10-14  Rudolf Hornig

	Now using Eclipse 4.3.1 as base for the IDE

2013-09-13  Tamas Borbely

	Implemented project specific image searches. The "image" folder of the
	project and its dependency projects are added to the image path. New image
	path is automatically used by the NED editor and other places where module
	are displayed. (Folder name is hardcoded now; this will be configurable
	in future releases).

	Additional changes:
	- Launch dialog contains a field to specify the --tkenv-image-path option;
	  by default its value is populated with the image path of the project
	  containing the working directory.
	- Added ${opp_image_path:dir} variable substitution.
	- Caches are invalidated if OMNETPP_IMAGE_PATH, the project dependencies, or
	  the image directories or files have changed.

	Also: NED palette scales images to 16x16 and 24x24. Previously the aspect
	ratio was kept.

2013-10-01  Andras Varga

	Scave: name of 'substract' filter changed to 'subtract' (typo)

2013-09-30  Levente Meszaros

	Sequence Chart: Fixed error handling when the error occurs in paint during
	startup.

2013-09-12  ------ omnetpp-4.3.1 released ------

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE is started with an empty workspace (e.g. on first-time
	launch), a dialog comes up automatically that offers the user the
	following options for getting something into the workspace:

	- Import the OMNeT++ sample simulations into the workspace
	- Download and install INET Framework

	The latter function is also available now via the Help > Install
	Simulation Models... menu item. The menu item brings up a dialog
	with the list of simulation models available for automated installation,
	and lets the user choose. Currently only the INET Framework is
	listed there, but it is planned to add further models.

2013-09-12  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	When the IDE was started for the first time, the user formerly saw an
	empty workbench window (apart from the imported samples). Now some
	helpful introductory pages are displayed in the editor area:

	- "Getting Started" - practical advice for getting past the first
	  10 minutes spent in the IDE

	- "At a Glance" - explains the common file types (NED, msg, ini) and
	  their purposes

	- "The Simulation Examples" - explains each example simulation in two
	  sentences, then provides links for opening the project, viewing the
	  README, launching the simulation, etc.

	These pages are also available in the Help system (except the last one,
	which has a dedicated menu item under the Help menu.)

2013-09-06  Andras Varga

	Run dialog > OMNeT++ Simulation > Launch tab: bug fixes:
	- pasting "a}" into the Working dir field caused weird behavior
	- pasting ${ into workingDir caused error dialog

2013-08-28  Andras Varga

	IDE: import sample projects even if workspace is different from omnetpp/samples

2013-06-06  Levente Meszaros

	Changed default appearance of the main welcome page to be more user friendly.

2013-09-03  Andras Varga

	IDE: trying to launch a closed project will now offer opening it

2013-08-26  Levente Meszaros

	Neddoc: fixed bug 672: Added escaping for replacement string.

2013-08-07  Tamas Borbély

	Output Vector View: show 'Goto ...' actions in the context menu
	(instead of the view's pulldown menu)

2013-08-07  Tamas Borbély

	Analysis Tool: fix #389 (Useless items in the Statistic Name filter)

	The filter hints of combos is now computed from the result items filtered
	by the other 2 combos.

2013-08-06  Tamas Borbély

	Analysis Tool: fix #388 (add '*.host[*].*' variant to module filter hints)

2013-08-09  Rudolf Hornig

	command line: fix for #670 -vmargs conflict between omnetpp.ini and
	the launcher script.

2013-04-02  ------ omnetpp-4.3 released ------

2013-03-17  Rudolf Hornig

	The debugger no longer stops at the main() symbol by default.

	Updated the IDE to Eclipse 3.8.2

2013-02-08  ------ omnetpp-4.3rc1 released ------

2012-12-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: the default gdbinit file is now ${opp_root}/misc/gdb/gdbinit.py
	when a new launch configuration is created.

	Also added support for project-specific gdbinit files: the .gdbinit.py
	script in the project root is now automatically sourced by the default
	init script. Project-specific gdbinit files can be used to initialize
	pretty printers specific to the project.

2011-11-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Launcher: for the running program, the configuration name is now
	correctly displayed in the Console view.

2012-12-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Debugging: switched over to the newer DSF debugger framework of CDT.

2012-11-30  Rudolf Hornig, Andras Varga

	IDE: Added support for opening files from the command line, i.e. the command

	  $ omnetpp Aloha.ned Aloha.cc

	will work as expected (opens these files on startup). If necessary,
	the IDE will open the containing projects if they are closed, and will
	even offer creating/importing a project if the files are outside all
	workspace projects.

2012-11-21  Levente Meszaros

	EventLog, Sequence Chart: better error reporting

2012-11-13  Rudolf Hornig

	CDT: disabled Code Analysis by default. It displayed tons of bogus
	"Semantic Errors" that totally confused novice users.

2012-11-06  Rudolf Hornig

	Command line: the build output is now less verbose (for gcc/mingw).
	Only the file names are printed when building, not whole command lines.

2012-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	Productizing: updated to Eclipse 3.8.1, removed our own linuxtools
	feature, changed to Cocoa framework from Carbon on OS X, moved to Java
	1.6 as a minimum requirement.

2012-10-16  Levente Meszaros

	Common: avoid showing a hover while any mouse button is pressed

2012-10-15  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: BaseLineChartEditForm: no loss of settings when clicking on lines
	without pressing Apply first

	The content of the controls are saved temporarily as properties of the
	selected lines.

2012-10-15  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: fix #604: display names were reset after setting another line
	property in the Properties dialog

2012-10-10  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: use set display names on legend of scatter charts

2012-10-07  Andras Varga

	IDE: registered "Small font" (appears in the Preferences dialog)

2012-10-11  Andras Varga

	Scave: remember last open tab of Chart Properties dialog

2012-10-13  Andras Varga

	Launcher: fix NPE

2012-08-29  Andras Varga

	Launcher: dialog: fix NPE when processing an omnetpp.ini without section header
	Launcher: dialog main page: cosmetics on labels

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga

	IDE: use StyledText instead of Browser for HTML hover information

	Motivation: The Browser widget is not always available on all platforms
	(constant xulrunner problems on Linux, etc).

2012-10-09  Levente Meszaros

	IDE: added Full Screen menu item, bound to Ctrl+Shift+F11

2012-07-17  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: major feature: implementation of computed scalars

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: fix #754: user defined chart area (minX/maxX/minY/maxY) can now
	be larger than the plot area computed from the data

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: fix #573/2: added hot keys for switching between the Vectors,
	Scalars, Histograms, All pages in the Browse Data page

	For switching between Inputs/Browse Data/Dataset pages, Alt+PgUp/PgDown
	can be used.

2012-07-09  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: fix #573: do not switch to VectorBrowser/Dataset view on page
	changes in the Browse Data page

2012-06-27  Tamas Borbely

	Scave: add 'logarithmic X axis' option to scatter chart (bug #573)

2012-10-03  Rudolf Hornig

	SeqChart: better error messages for the Goto Simulation Time dialog

2012-03-28  Andras Varga

	IDE: launcher: fix ".cc file cannot be launched" bug. Now we interpret
	it that as if the file's parent folder was selected.

2012-01-15  Andras Varga

	IDE: added named connections support to:
	- Property View
	- Properties Dialog in graphical mode
	- content assist in NED editor

	TODO: inifile editor

2012-03-26  Andras Varga

	IDE: fix: change remaining KB/MB to KiB/MiB

2012-03-13  Rudolf Hornig

	Scave: removed export support for Matlab script output.
	The generated script was syntactically incorrect, plus Matlab uses only
	the first 63 chars as identifiers, and this causes collisions between names.

	CSV should be used as data export for Matlab.

	* Before running a simulation, the IDE will show the command line in
	 the console view to help you execute the same simulation from the
	 command line.

	* CTRL-TAB now works on freshly opened NED files even if you do not explicitly
	 select a simple module. In this case the IDE opens the .h and .cc files
	 associated with the first simple module in the NED file.

2011-05-05  ------ omnetpp-4.2b2 released ------

2011-05-03 Levente Meszaros

2011-02-23  ------ omnetpp-4.2b1 released ------

2011-02-05 Andras Varga

	* Several performance optimizations for the NED Editor. It must be able to
	open networks containing around 10.000 submodules.

	* Performance: NED validation is done now in a background thread

2011-02-03 Rudolf Hornig

	* Graphical editor: Figure borders and outlines now correctly follow the zoom level.

	* Graphical editor: The resize/move feedback figures have been changed to
	transparent blue from a simple outline.

2011-02-03 Levente Meszaros

	* Added Technology Preview version of the network animator. It works only
	on .elog files smaller than 10Mb. You can open it by right clicking on an
	.elog file and selection "Open with...". This implementation is NOT optimized
	for larger files.

2011-02-01 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Files are refreshed now before opening. No more "file is out of sync"
	message if the opened NED file was modified outside of the IDE.

2011-02-01 Andras Varga

	* Simulation launcher: Size of the popup information tooltip is limited
	when displaying all the runs (i.e. whan the parameter space is too big)

2011-01-31 Levente Meszaros

	* Added the possibility to go to a specific simulation time in event log
	view by specifying relative values (+-) in the dialog (units are supported)

	* In sequence chart added 'Goto simulation time' and 'Goto event number'
	in the context menu

	* Sequence chart: the current position is shown in the gutter

	* Completion proposals in inner types after @ are working properly in NED text editor

2011-01-28 Andras Varga

	* NED type selection dialog now optionally shows the defining projects for the types.

2011-01-24 Rudolf Hornig

	* Context menu in graphical editor is reorganized for better and easier access of the
	 most used functions.

	* Linux tools now included in the build. It allows to profile the simulation
	using Valgrind on Linux systems. (Windows and Mac builds does not have
	this capability). Use the "Profile as" menu item in the context menu of
	the project directory.

2011-01-21 Rudolf Hornig

	* Go to C++ definiton (CTRL-TAB) now correctly finds the appropriate C++ class even if the
	NED type is extending another type or it is using the @class property. (bug #238)

2011-01-20 Rudolf Hornig

	* In graphical editor the previous action used with double click (go to
	type or supertype) has ben moved to the F3 key. It is also available
	from the context menu.

2011-01-20 Andras Varga

	* Added a brand new Property dialog that can be accessed by double clicking
	on the module or type. Type, name, vector size and graphical properties
	are supported. A preview is shown at the bottom	of the dialog.

	* Enhanced Ned Type Selection dialog (CTRL-SHIFT-N)

2011-01-18 Rudolf Hornig

	* The package name for the ned file is shown at the top in the graphical editor

	* Support for displaying self-connections in the graphical editor as
	an arch in the upper right corner

2011-01-13 Rudolf Hornig

	* Validator used for entering type names (in the Property View) now correctly
	supports inner types and packages

2011-01-07 Rudolf Hornig

	* NED Editor now supports drag-and-drop operations of inner types (moving
	an inner type to top level, or the other way around). Types dropped inside
	the submodule area create a submodule with that type. Types dropped on the
	title area of the compound module create an inner type.

2011-01-06 Andras Varga

	* Unit name now can be set in property editor for compound modules

2011-01-04 Andras Varga

	* Compound module border now can be set to 0 width

2011-01-04 Rudolf Hornig

	* In the graphical editor, inner types can now be created by dropping
	a NED type on the title of the compound module

2011-01-03 Rudolf Hornig

	* The simulation process is now started by using relative paths. The
	command line displayed in the console when the process start has
	failed is much more readable now.

2010-12-22 Rudolf Hornig

	* Property cell editors for type, liketype, extends properties on simple
	modules, compound modules, channels, submodules and connections are now
	displaying all the possible types correctly. Cells contents are validated
	so nonexistent types cannot be used.

2010-12-17 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #230. The values for Type, Like and Extends property on a
	submodule/connections/or NED type (top-level or inner) are initialized
	correctly. They contain correct values according to the current lookup context.

	* Cloning or creating new inner types using the graphical editor now
	generates unique names correctly

2010-12-16 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the palette entry ordering in NED editor to include inner types
	in the current file on the top.

2010-12-15 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed #229. In NED Editor: Inherited display property values can be
	leared now using "-" as a value. It is possible now to remove an icon
	even if the ancestor specified one.

2010-12-14 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed the tooltip of the "Display property" in the properties view. No longer displays null[0]

2010-12-13 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#224. NPEs when cloning submodules with connections which are defined in an ancestor module.
	* Fixed bug#227. NPE on upinning a submodule

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Added plugin customization to force workspace refresh on IDE startup.

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

	* Fixed bug#213. NPE occurred in NedEditorLauncher if the filesystem and the
	workspace got out of sync.

2010-12-11 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix of bug #145: Open NED Type dialog comes up empty on first invocation
	NedTypeSelectionDialog now contains a INedChangeListener, and any NED
	change triggers a delayed update of the displayed list.

	* IDE: fix for bug #223: bogus "X seems to be a hand-written makefile" message
	when the makefile was deleted from the disk behind the IDE's back

2010-12-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Changed the default OMNeT++ source code formatter profile to match the
	current INET coding convention. Profile is using only spaces instead of
	tabs for indentation.

2010-12-10 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fix for bug #222: Chinese comments become gibberish in NED files.
	Solution: wherever possible, save files in the file's own encoding
	(i.e. charset), using content.getBytes(ifile.getCharset()).

2010-12-06 Rudolf Hornig

	* IDE: Added a "Clean Selected Projects" menuitem to the project explorer context menu.
	This item DOES NOT clean referred projects.

2010-11-10 Rudolf Hornig

	* Support for Profiling (in addition to Debug and Run modes). (enable to use linuxtools with valgrind)

2010-10-19 Rudolf Hornig

	* MachO64 parser support added for new CDT projects. Updated error parsers provided by CDT 7.x.

2010-09-30 Rudolf Hornig

	* Updated the base system to Eclipse 3.6.1

2010-09-22 Andras Varga

	* IDE: fixed resolution of parametric submodule types in NedTreeTraversal

	* IDE: refined the resolution of parametric submodule types
	The actual type needs to be resolved in the project of the inifile,
	not in the project of the compound module that contains the submodule
	(for example, udpApp's type need not be in StandardHost's project INET,
	it may also come from a project that has INET as dependency)

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* Scave: Line type on vector chart did get reflected in the Chart Properties
	dialog (issue 182). When the line property has the same value for each
	selected line in the Properties dialog, then that value is displayed in
	the control, instead of 'No change'.

	* Scave: Empty chart if refreshing a temp chart after re-running simulation
	(issue 186). When creating a temp chart, runs was identified by runname,
	now they are identified by file/configname/runnumber.  'Add Selected Data
	to Dataset' and 'Convert to Dataset' actions also use the file/configname/
	runnumber fields for consistency.

2010-07-19 Levente Meszaros

	* SeqChart: Fixed a NPE.

	* SeqChart: fix handling show/hide [self] message reuses toggle buttons
	There was some confusion between those buttons, now they toggle showing/hidign
	only for those arrows that they represent.

	* SeqChart: fix message reuse arrows when affected by a module method call
	The end point for a message reuse was wrong. It used the event's module of
	the begin send entry instead of the context module to determine the Y coordinate.

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* fix issue 180: fixed assert when double coordinate is +-Infinite

	* fix issue 196: use file/configname/runnumber to identify runs of temp chart data

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

	* BaseLineChartEditForm: fix issue 182
	When the line property has the same value for each selected line,
	then that value is displayed in the control instead of 'No change'.

2010-07-12 Tamas Borbely

	* small layout fix in BaseLineChartEditForm

2010-07-08 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix focus problems (bug #188) by using the new FocusManager class

2010-07-07 Andras Varga

	* Scave: drawing timeouts come now from preferences

	* Scave: time limit facility for line chart plotting

	* Scave: removed smartMode in LinePlot as it was responsible for bug #181
	Turning off symbols for DOTS line type resulted in empty chart.
	http://dev.omnetpp.org/bugs/view.php?id=181

	* SeqChart: axis ordering dialog layout improved: buttons move to the right

	* SeqChart: fix: "Show self-messages" button (blue arched arrow) also toggled
	self-reuse (green) arrows on the chart

2010-06-23 Levente Meszaros

	* Sequence Chart: Fix for find text bug. Find text did not work in filtered eventlogs.

	* Cleanup the show/hide flags related to message send/reuse arrows.
	A couple of renames and minor tweaks, namely arrows are categorized along
	two axes: reuse/send, self/other.

2010-06-22 Andras Varga

	* Scave: fix unreadable (black-on-black) filter combo dropdown on ubuntu 10.04
	in Ubuntu 10.04: in the default theme, combo editfield is black-on-white
	and dropdown list is white-on-black, so calling setForeground() on the combo
	will inevitably make one of them unreadable. Workaround: do NOT call
	getForeground().

2010-06-11  ------ omnetpp-4.1 released ------

2010-05-31  ------ omnetpp-4.1rc2 released ------

2010-04-20  ------ omnetpp-4.1b4 released ------

2009-08-03  Levente Meszaros

	* Connection chooser brings up channel chooser when using the default
	connection tool and there are matching labels between the connected
	gates and an available channel type.

	* Palette shows NED types in two distinct groups: the first contains
	those which are related to the current editor ordered by score, the
	second contains all available types ordered by name

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	* Text editor provides new context menu items to infer/distribute gate labels.

2009-07-15  Levente Meszaros

	* Palette provides regexp based substring filtering for qualified NED
	type names and @label properties.

	* Palette sorts submodules based on what is actually already used, what
	could be connected and @contains properties.

2009-07-14  Levente Meszaros

	* Added support for matching @labels properties of gates in the connection
	chooser popup menu.

2009-07-13  Levente Meszaros

	* Added validation to parameters dialog, reserved NED words cannot be
	parameter names, and parameter values must be valid expressions.

2009-06-09  Levente Meszaros

	* SEQCHART: Added sequence chart support to display module method calls
	as vertical orange arrows. The arrow's label is the method's name,
	tooltips are also available.

	* Some message send arrows were drawn incorrectly from the caller module
	due to not taking into consideration module method calls. From now on
	these kind of arrows might start from any point on a module's axis,
	even if there was no event at that simulation time in the callee module.

	* Store various show/hide flags in sequence chart eventlog configuration files.

2009-03-12  ------ omnetpp-4.0 released ------
